## 3. Defining SLIs and SLOs

#### userstory                                                           SLI
Check useful graphics  
#### SLO 
1. available 99.95% 
2. 5% of requests complete in under 300 ms
#### SLI
1. Fraction of 200 vs 500 HTTP responses from 
API endpoint measured per day 
2. Time to last byte GET requests measured 
every 10 seconds aggregated per minute  

## 4. Design microservices for your application

### Service , http, TCP(yes), UDP


## 9. Diagramming your network
### diagram that depicts how your services will communicate over the network. Include regions, zones, load balancers, CDN, and DNS if applicable

## 10. Designing reliable, scalable applications
### Even if some service is down, we want the web frontend of our application to be available nearly all the time. We also want the website to be fast with very low latency to users all over the world. On the next slide, draw a diagram that depicts how we can achieve this using Google Cloud services.

## 11a. Disaster recovery scenario
### You've deployed for high availability by replicating resources in multiple zones. However, to meet regulatory requirements, you need a plan to recover from a disaster that brings down the entire region. The current architecture is depicted below. On the next slide, create a plan to bring up your application in another region if your main region is down.
